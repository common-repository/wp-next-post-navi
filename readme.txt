== Description ==

WP Next Post Navi Plugin can easily add a Previous Post and Next Post link on your blog. You can choose to use buttons or text link.

This plugin gives you customization options to make the buttons blend in with your blog's theme. So changed the color to match your blog or to make the buttons stand out.

Use custom text as well or choose to show the blog post title.

If you don't want to use text links or buttons then you have the option to use images. Use your own images or use the ones that comes with the plugin.

When viewing the latest posts on your blog, there will be an option to show a message showing next post coming soon or you can disable it.
